                <p>Along with the Five Pillars, our approach is guided by five values which underpin all of the areas of our work.</p>
                <p>Our Academies serve young people in the communities in which they are located, and also systemise and codify programmes so that they become training centres for partner organisations in the Fight for Peace Alliance. In addition, they create local partnerships in order to provide additional services not provided by the key areas of the Five Pillars methodology.</p>
                <p>Our Academies develop and implement innovative programmes and pilot projects, all based on our methodology, with the aim of delivering support for young peopleâ€™s personal development.</p>
